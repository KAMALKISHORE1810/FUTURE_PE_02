UGC Script 1:
I wasted months working out and saw no progress.
Turns out I wasn’t eating enough protein.
I started using Accord Fit after workouts,
and recovery feels way faster now.
If you're starting gym, don’t ignore protein.
It changes everything.

UGC Script 2:
I thought gym results just take time.
But I was underfueling my body the whole time.
Adding Accord Fit protein after training
made my workouts actually show results.
If you’re a beginner, fix your nutrition early.

UGC Script 3:
I blamed my workouts for slow progress.
But the real issue was protein intake.
Accord Fit made it easy to hit daily goals.
Now I finally see muscle growth.
Beginners — don’t repeat my mistake.

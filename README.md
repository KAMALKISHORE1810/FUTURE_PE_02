The goal was to design a reusable structured prompt system capable of producing high-converting Instagram Reel scripts for a real-world fitness brand.

Chosen brand: Accord Fit  
Product: Protein powder for gym beginners

## Objective
Create a repeatable prompt framework that generates:
- multiple ad hooks
- short UGC scripts

- Instagram captions

The system follows a proven ad framework:
Hook → Problem → Solution → CTA

## Prompt Logic
The prompt structure controls:
- tone (authentic UGC voice)
- audience targeting
- platform format
- ad pacing
- conversion intent

This ensures outputs are marketing-ready,
not generic AI text.

## Tools Used

- Simplified AI (optional video demo)

## Outcome
A complete UGC ad content pack that can be used by:
- marketing agencies
- D2C brands
- content creators
- paid ad campaigns

This workflow simulates real-world AI content marketing.
